# Write a Data Science Blog Post

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is for you to show off your technical skills, but more importantly for you to begin putting together a portfolio that shows your ability to effectively communicate technical results.

## Overview

- Come up with three questions you are interested in answering.
- Extract the necessary data to answer these questions.
- Perform necessary cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
- Evaluate your results.
- Share your insights with stakeholders in a blog post.

## Steps

Follow the CRISP-DM process in finding your solutions.

1) Pick a dataset, as mentioned on the previous page.

2) Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.

3) Create a Jupyter Notebook, using any associated packages you'd like, to:

    Prepare data:
    - Gather necessary data to answer your questions
    - Handle categorical and missing data
    - Provide insight into the methods you chose and why you chose them
    Analyze, Model, and Visualize
    - Provide a clear connection between your business questions and how the data answers them

4) Communicate your business insights:

- Create a Github repository to share your code and data wrangling/modeling techniques, with a technical audience in mind
- Create a blog post to share your questions and insights with a non-technical audience

## Project Deliverables

There are two deliverables that are required for project completion.

- A Github repository for your code.
- A blog post of your findings.
